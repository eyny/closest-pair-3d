# Closest Pair of Points in 3D
A project I prepared in school for **BLG 336E Analysis of Algorithms II** course. It finds the closest pair of points in three dimensional space using [divide-and-conquer algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm). C++ programming language is used to develop the project. The compiled program needs a text file as argument which indicates the 3D coordinates of the points. The further and detailed information about the project can be found in the report file in report folder.

## Requirements
A C++ compiler with C++11 support is required to compile the source files. The data files must be formatted as follows:
**First line:** *The total number of the points*
**Other lines:** *Each line specifies a point with X, Y and Z axes as integers with a space between axes.*

You can examine the files in data folder to understand the data format.
